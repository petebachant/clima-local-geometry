ANALYSIS & KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. BASIC GEOMETRY ACCESS OVERHEAD:
   Full LocalGeometry (J only):      8.0%
   Extracted J:                      6.0%

2. STRUCT SIZE IMPACT (accessing single field):
   TwoFieldGeom (16 bytes):          7.4%
   FourFieldGeom (32 bytes):         8.5%
   EightFieldGeom (64 bytes):        7.1%
   SixteenFieldGeom (128 bytes):     9.2%

   ✓ All struct sizes show similar performance - good inlining

3. PROJECTION OPERATIONS OVERHEAD:
   Covariant->Contravariant:         -1.9%

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

⚠️  MODERATE OVERHEAD DETECTED:
   • LocalGeometry overhead: 8.0%
   • Projection overhead: -1.9%

   CONSIDER:
   1. Extract commonly-used components (J, WJ) at kernel entry
   2. Profile with nsys to see actual bandwidth/occupancy impact:
      ./scripts/run-nsys.sh --output=results/nsys/benchmark_lg \
          julia --project scripts/benchmark_local_geometry_impact.jl

======================================================================
CODE INSPECTION NOTES
======================================================================
To verify compiler inlining behavior:

1. Check LLVM IR for a simple kernel:
   julia> f(x, lg) = x + lg.J
   julia> @code_llvm f(1.0, first(local_geom_full))

   Look for: Should see direct field access, not function calls

2. Check PTX assembly for CUDA kernels:
   julia> using CUDA
   julia> kernel(x, lg) = (@inbounds x[1] += lg[1].J; nothing)
   julia> @device_code_ptx kernel(CuArray([1.0]), parent(local_geom_full))

   Look for: ld.param instructions (should be minimal for inlined structs)

3. Use nsys to profile actual memory bandwidth:
   ./scripts/run-nsys.sh --output=results/nsys/benchmark_lg \
       julia --project scripts/benchmark_local_geometry_impact.jl

   Then analyze with:
   nsys stats results/nsys/benchmark_lg.nsys-rep

   Look for: Memory bandwidth utilization, kernel occupancy
