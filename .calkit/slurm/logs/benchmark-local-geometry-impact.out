ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Key findings:
  Full LocalGeometry overhead:     7.1%
  Extracted J overhead:            6.2%
  Simplified geometry overhead:    2.6%

⚠️  MODERATE OVERHEAD: LocalGeometry has ~3-10% performance cost
   Consider targeted optimizations (extract components, caching)

======================================================================
INTERPRETATION
======================================================================
The overhead depends on:
  1. How often LocalGeometry is accessed per kernel call
  2. What proportion of LocalGeometry components are actually used
  3. Whether multiple threads compete for cache/bandwidth

In real ClimaAtmos kernels:
  • LocalGeometry is accessed at every grid point
  • Most kernels use only J or (J, WJ) - not full tensors
  • This can amplify overhead in bandwidth-bound operations

Recommendations:
  1. If overhead > 10%: Refactor to simplified geometry types
  2. If overhead 3-10%: Extract J/WJ at kernel entry, pass separately
  3. If overhead < 3%: Keep as-is; focus on other optimizations

Next steps:
  • Run this benchmark on real physics kernels (not just synthetic ops)
  • Profile with NVIDIA Nsight Compute to measure bandwidth efficiency
  • Test with actual ClimaAtmos configurations
