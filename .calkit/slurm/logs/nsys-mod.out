ClimaDiagnostics Waiting for background task / IO / timer.
[pid 867660] waiting for IO to finish:
 Handle type        uv_handle_t->data
 fs_event           0x1d1e7b0->0x7f3f95357b50
 timer              0x27ca2b0->0x7f3f95357bb0
This means that a package has started a background task or event source that has not finished running. For precompilation to complete successfully, the event source needs to be closed explicitly. See the developer documentation on fixing precompilation hangs for more help.
